# AI Diagnostic Prototypes

Ethical AI tools built since October 2025: prompt frameworks for unbiased analysis, anomaly detection, and systems diagnostics. Focus on safety boundaries, contradiction preservation, and vulnerability-like deviation flagging.

## Key Prototypes
- **MIT Protocol** – Multimodal triangulation for friction/agency detection  
  [Protocol](protocols/MIT-PROTOCOL.md) | [Fictional Demo](examples/mit-fictional-demo.md)
- **Theoretical System Interpreter** – Neutral theory exploration  
  [Protocol](protocols/THEORETICAL-SYSTEM-INTERPRETER.md)
- **Kīlauea UCT/AMC Engine** – Volcanic phase transition monitor  
  [Protocol](protocols/KILAUEA-UCT-AMC-DIAGNOSTIC-ENGINE.md)
- **Front Attack Classroom Bridge** – Pedagogical scaffolding  
  [Protocol](protocols/FRONT-ATTACK-CLASSROOM-BRIDGE.md)
- **SpaceX Engine Anomaly Monitor** – Telemetry coherence & anomaly demo
