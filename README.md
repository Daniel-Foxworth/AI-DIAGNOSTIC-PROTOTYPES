# AI Diagnostic Prototypes

Collection of ethical AI prompt frameworks, diagnostic tools, and optimization scripts built since October 2025.  
Focus: Responsible prompt engineering, anomaly detection, coherence monitoring, and systems analysis.

## Folders
- `/protocols` — Core prompt protocols (copy-paste ready for any AI chat)
- `/examples` — Demonstrations and test runs (see how they work in practice)

## Key Prototypes
- **MIT Protocol: Multimodal Information Triangulation**  
  Detects informational pulses, friction points, exclusions, and agency deviations across four fields.  
  → [View Protocol](protocols/MIT-PROTOCOL.md)  
  → [Fictional Site 002 Demo](examples/mit-fictional-demo.md)

- **Theoretical System Interpretation Protocol**  
  Unbiased exploration of theories without consensus bias.  
  → Coming soon

- **Batch Coherence Monitor**  
  Windows script for legacy hardware stability (+14% battery life).  
  → Coming soon in `/scripts`

All work developed with strict ethical boundaries—focus on safety and truth-seeking.

For job applications (e.g., xAI Safety Tutor) or collaboration.
