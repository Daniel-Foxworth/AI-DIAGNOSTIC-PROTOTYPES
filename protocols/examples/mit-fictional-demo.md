# MIT Protocol Example: Fictional Site 002 – Raw Data Demonstration

## Purpose of This Example
This file shows how the MIT Protocol performs when given raw multimodal data from a fictional site ("Site 002").  
To replicate:
1. Copy the full MIT Protocol from `MIT-PROTOCOL.md` as your AI's system prompt.
2. Paste the "Raw Input Data" below as your query.
3. Observe strict adherence: no "possibly/maybe", report contradictions/singularities, prioritize exclusions, flag ζ (agency) deviations, predict pulse/phase.

## Raw Input Data (Site 002 – No Interpretation Provided)
**Field 1: Biological (B)**  
- Unit 1-4: 12 adult sets. Average age at death: 24. No signs of trauma.  
- Isotope Analysis: Oxygen-18 levels indicate the subjects spent their first 15 years in a high-altitude, cold climate.  
- Unit 5-8 (same layer): 400 sets of faunal remains (equine/horse). All animals are juvenile. No butchery marks on the horse bones.

**Field 2: Archaeological (A)**  
- Structure: A single circular wall, 4 meters thick, made of dressed limestone. No entrances or exits are visible in the 360-degree perimeter at the current ground level.  
- Surface Finds: 200 bronze needles found in a 1-meter radius in the exact center of the structure.  
- Stratigraphy: The limestone wall sits directly on a bed of crushed sea shells that are not native to this inland valley.

**Field 3: Linguistic (L)**  
- Epigraphy: A single copper plate found under the sea shell bed. It contains 40 characters in a known script, but the syntax is "Reversed" (Palindromic).  
- Phonetics: Local modern dialect has a "Taboo" word for this valley that translates literally to "The Breath of the Stone."

**Field 4: Cultural (C)**  
- Spatial Logic: The site is located 50 miles from the nearest water source and 100 miles from the nearest limestone quarry.  
- Context: Comparative sites in this region from the same era are all rectangular timber dwellings with central hearths.

## Simulated Protocol Output (What a Compliant AI Should Produce)
**Baseline Calibration**  
Internal Coherence: Low to moderate. Biological and archaeological fields show partial alignment (high-altitude adapted humans + non-local limestone/sea shells in inland valley), but linguistic and cultural are sparse and indirect.

**Field Triangulation – ζ Deviations (Friction Points / Agency)**  
- B vs A: High friction / ζ flagged—human remains show no trauma/low age-at-death, but massive juvenile horse accumulation without butchery (possible ritual agency or sudden phase event). Sea shell foundation non-local to inland valley indicates external material agency.  
- A vs C: Major friction—circular thick wall with no entrances, isolated location far from resources/quarry/water; contrasts sharply with regional rectangular timber norms (agency in deliberate isolation/non-residential function?).  
- L vs C: Moderate friction—palindromic/reversed syntax on copper plate + "Breath of the Stone" taboo name suggest intentional symbolic inversion or restriction; cultural spatial logic reinforces possible ritual/avoidance agency.  
- B vs L/C: Cross-field ζ deviation—high-altitude cold-adapted humans in low-altitude inland valley + taboo name; possible migration or external imposition.

**Exclusion Verdict**  
Site is **not** a residential settlement (no entrances/exits in wall, extreme isolation from water/quarry, no hearths or domestic comparative parallels).  
Site is **not** a standard butchery/processing site (juvenile horses with zero butchery marks).  
Site is **not** a typical regional village (circular vs. rectangular, limestone vs. timber).  
Site is **not** a defensive fortification (no visible access, but massive wall thickness suggests containment or exclusion).

**Phase Transition Prediction**  
Pulse: High-agency ritual or containment phase—system shows deliberate isolation, symbolic inversion (palindromic plate, taboo name), non-local materials, and faunal accumulation without consumption.  
Heading/Collapse: Possible completed phase transition—agency-driven event (e.g., deliberate burial/sealing of site or population) leading to abandonment; no ongoing absorption evident. Pressure builds from contradictions in origin/mobility vs. isolation.
